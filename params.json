  "body": "### Who\r\nI am Frank Matranga, a 16-year-old high school student of Regis High School in the one and only New York city.\r\n\r\n### About Me\r\nI'm a very *opinionated* person, as those who know me well can testify. I'm experienced in many fields of computer science, most specifically programming. I make websites and projects for my classmates in the spare time that I have. I'm known as the computer guy at my school.\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nI have worked on whatever I can get my hands on. Big projects include **OnTrac**, a huge productivty service/website I ran for all Regis kids in Freshman-Sophomore year that was shut down by my school before it could take off. I also started, programmed, and still personally manage a **Discord** server for all Regis kids. Every project of mine so far has been done totally solo and I am still seeking open source projects that I can contribute to as I know it is vital to learn to work to develop with others.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nOn all social media I go by **@frankmatranga**, but I generally don't use any of the services, I just have accounts to establish myself there. I can be reached at [my Gmail](mailto:thefrankmatranga@gmail.com) or [my school email](mailto:fmatranga18@regis.org)",

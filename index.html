<a id="who" class="anchor" href="#who" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who</h3>

<p>I am Frank Matranga, a 16-year-old high school student of Regis High School in the one and only New York city.</p>

<h3>
<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I'm a very <em>opinionated</em> person, as those who know me well can testify. I try to focus on self-improvement when I can, and it has helped me to become a very observant person. 
  I understand my own flaws and I try to always be working to improve on them. I am wary of the value of the time we are given and I hate
  wasting any time that can be spent doing something productive. I'm experienced in many fields of computer science, most specifically programming. I make websites and projects for my classmates in the spare time that I have.</p>

<h3>
<a id="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h3>

<p>I have worked on whatever I can get my hands on. Big projects include <strong>OnTrac</strong>, a huge productivty service/website I ran for all Regis kids in Freshman-Sophomore year that was shut down by my school before it could take off. I also started, programmed, and still personally manage a <strong>Discord</strong> server for all Regis kids. Every project of mine so far has been done totally solo and I am still seeking open source projects that I can contribute to as I know it is vital to learn to work to develop with others.</p>

<a id="contact" class="anchor" href="#contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contact</h3>

<p>On all social media I go by <strong>@frankmatranga</strong>, but I generally don't use any of the services, I just have accounts to establish myself there. I can be reached at <a href="mailto:thefrankmatranga@gmail.com">my Gmail</a> or <a href="mailto:fmatranga18@regis.org">my school email</a></p>
